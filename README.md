# Ensemble-Techniques

## Objective:
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a
term deposit (variable y).

## Steps and tasks:
1. Import the necessary libraries
2. Read the data as a data frame
3. Perform basic EDA which should include the following and print out your insights at every step.
  a. Shape of the data
  b. Data type of each attribute
  c. Checking the presence of missing values
  d. 5 point summary of numerical attributes
  e. Checking the presence of outliers
4. Prepare the data to train a model â€“ check if data types are appropriate, get rid of the missing values etc
5. Train a few standard classification algorithms, note and comment on their performances along different metrics.
6. Build the ensemble models and compare the results with the basemodels. 
7. Compare performances of all the models

## Note: Random forest can be used only with Decision trees.
